Octopress is an obsessively designed framework for Jekyll blogging. It's easy to configure and easy to deploy. Sweet huh?

1. **Octopress sports a clean responsive theme** written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
2. **Code blogging is easy and beautiful.** Embed code (with [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) styling) in your posts from gists or from your filesystem.
3. **Third party integration is simple** with built-in support for Twitter, Pinboard, Delicious, Disqus Comments, and Google Analytics.
4. **It's easy to use.** A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
5. **Ships with great plugins** some original and others from the Jekyll community &mdash; tested and improved.
